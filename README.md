# File_Compare


## Utility
This desktop application features the ability to compare two files and display any unique lines or unique line count, 
regardless of sorted order in either file.  

## Themes
It boasts three themes: Dark, Light, and Purple.
Each one is selectable from the menu and the program will retain the theme selection even after closing until it is
changed by the user.
